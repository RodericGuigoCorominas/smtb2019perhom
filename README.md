## Topological Data Analysis in Python (SMTB 2019)

These are the materials, slides and jupyter notebooks of the course I taught at the School of Molecular and Theoretical Biology the summer of 2019 in Barcelona on Topological Data Analysis and Python.

### The Shape of Data

What information can we obtain from the shape of point cloud data?
